nuxeo-palette
===========================

This plugin enables to order content of a folder on a grid.
## About 
The project provides a widget template that will create a grid where to order the thumbnails of a folder content on a grid using drag and drop. 
The template uses several automation operations to get or set the items of the palettes.

-  `Services.GetPaletteItems`operation is the way to get the items, it renders a JSON String containing  document ids with order, position X and Y, and size. An order 0 means it's a new element.

Example of JSON String generated by the operation:

[{"id":"85d80ab6-1296-4939-a1d3-9d6da1e7eae2","thumburl":"http://localhost:8080/nuxeo/nxthumb/default/85d80ab6-1296-4939-a1d3-9d6da1e7eae2/thumb:thumbnail/Small_ic_looks_one_grey600_48dp.jpg","order":"0"},{"col":"1","size_y":"1","size_x":"1","id":"f7a78334-8813-46b5-ac26-ed8923f9e7b5","row":"1","thumburl":"http://localhost:8080/nuxeo/nxthumb/default/f7a78334-8813-46b5-ac26-ed8923f9e7b5/thumb:thumbnail/Small_ic_looks_two_grey600_48dp.jpg","order":"1"},{"col":"6","size_y":"1","size_x":"1","id":"1358a39f-efb5-47cd-8352-c91273c69c75","row":"1","thumburl":"http://localhost:8080/nuxeo/nxthumb/default/1358a39f-efb5-47cd-8352-c91273c69c75/thumb:thumbnail/Small_ic_looks_3_grey600_48dp.jpg","order":"6"}]

## TODO
* Collection support
* More control on the grid through widget properties (like columns and row, max size...) that are hardcoded in the js part.
* Enable a possibility to get the items in the right order.



## Third Party Tools Used
* gridster.js, dsmorse fork: [http://dsmorse.github.io/gridster.js/](http://dsmorse.github.io/gridster.js/). Some modification made to prevent collision where the lib called `root.$` as `$`is Prototype in Nuxeo and not jQuery.
